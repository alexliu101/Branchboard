# Branchboard - Personal Strategy Cockpit

Branchboard is a progressive web application designed for strategic planning in uncertain environments. Rather than assuming a single timeline, it enables users to map multiple possible futures and adapt their planning as circumstances evolve.

## Core Philosophy

**Branch-Native Planning**: Traditional planning tools assume a linear progression through time. Branchboard recognises that the future is inherently uncertain and provides tools to prepare for multiple scenarios simultaneously.

**Signal-Driven Adaptation**: The application monitors early indicators and provides recommendations when circumstances suggest a shift towards alternative scenarios, enabling proactive rather than reactive planning.

**Privacy-First Architecture**: All strategic thinking remains on your device through an offline-first design, with optional cloud synchronisation available for those who require it.

## Feature Implementation Status

### Fully Implemented Features

- **Today View**: Daily interface featuring now/next/later task organisation, integrated focus timer, and current branch status display
- **Branch Maps**: Interactive graph-based scenario planning utilising Cytoscape.js for visualisation
- **Signals System**: Monitoring of early indicators with automated alerts when branch switching is recommended
- **Dynamic Branch Switching**: Automatic task list updates when transitioning between scenarios
- **Task Scheduler**: Optimisation engine employing heuristic algorithms with deadline and dependency awareness
- **Calendar Integration**: FullCalendar implementation for dated events with branch map creation capabilities
- **Scenario Management**: Undated "what-if" scenarios with configurable priority levels
- **Comprehensive Data Model**: Local-first database architecture using Dexie.js
- **Progressive Web Application**: Installable application with full offline functionality

### Features Under Development

- **Weekly Review**: Basic framework implemented, requiring full feature completion
- **Option Expiry Tracking**: Infrastructure established, awaiting implementation completion
- **Import/Export**: Data structure prepared, user interface development pending

## Technical Architecture

**Frontend Framework**: SvelteKit 5 with modern reactive programming patterns
**Database Layer**: Dexie.js (IndexedDB wrapper) providing local-first storage capabilities
**Progressive Web Application**: @vite-pwa/sveltekit for service worker implementation and application manifest
**Scheduling Engine**: Custom optimisation engine with heuristic fallback mechanisms
**User Interface Components**: 
- Cytoscape.js for interactive branch map visualisations
- FullCalendar for comprehensive calendar views
- Custom Svelte components for all other interface elements

## Getting Started

### System Requirements
- Node.js version 18 or higher
- npm or pnpm package manager

### Installation

```bash
cd branchboard
npm install
```

### Development Environment

```bash
npm run dev
```

Access the application at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your preferred browser.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Progressive Web Application Installation

1. Launch the application in a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)
2. Locate the "Install" or "Add to Home Screen" option in your browser interface
3. The application will function offline once installation is complete

## Application Usage Guide

### 1. **Daily Operations**
- Review your current branch status and any triggered signals
- Focus on now/next/later task organisation
- Utilise the integrated focus timer for concentrated work sessions
- Capture thoughts and tasks quickly through the quick capture interface

### 2. **Scenario Creation**
- Add dated events such as meetings and deadlines
- Create undated scenarios for potential future situations (career changes, relocation)
- Select any item to generate a corresponding Branch Map

### 3. **Branch Mapping**
- Add decision nodes representing choices under your control
- Add chance nodes representing external factors beyond your influence
- Add outcome nodes representing potential end states
- Connect nodes to illustrate relationships and dependencies
- Mark significant nodes as actionable tasks
- Configure signals to detect when specific branches are becoming relevant

### 4. **Branch Configuration**
- Designate which branch you are currently operating under
- Tasks from active branches become immediately actionable
- Tasks from inactive branches remain dormant until required

### 5. **Signal Monitoring**
- Update signal values as circumstances evolve
- Receive notifications when threshold values are exceeded
- Switch branches when signals indicate changing conditions
- Tasks automatically update to reflect new operational reality

### 6. **Schedule Optimisation**
- Allow Branchboard to schedule your active tasks automatically
- System respects deadlines, dependencies, and priority levels
- Schedule updates automatically when branch switching occurs
- Review comprehensive dashboards for high-level strategic overview

## Design Philosophy

**Branch-First Approach**: Every planning process acknowledges uncertainty from the initial stages

**Signal-Driven Adaptation**: Early indicators facilitate adaptation before circumstances become critical

**Context-Aware Operations**: Tasks maintain clear connections to their strategic purpose and the future scenarios they support

**Local Data Ownership**: Strategic thinking remains under your control rather than being stored on external servers

**Lightweight Architecture**: Fast, simple, and focused on essential functionality

## Planned Enhancements

- **Advanced Optimisation**: Integration of jsLPSolver for complex scheduling requirements
- **Real-time Signal Processing**: API integrations enabling automatic signal updates
- **Collaborative Features**: Shared scenarios with private branch capabilities
- **Advanced Analytics**: Prediction accuracy tracking and performance metrics
- **Mobile Applications**: Native iOS and Android versions via Capacitor framework

## Technical Specifications

**Bundle Size**: Approximately 500KB (optimised)
**Offline Storage**: Unlimited capacity through IndexedDB
**Performance**: 60fps interactions with task updates under 100ms
**Browser Compatibility**: Chrome 88+, Firefox 85+, Safari 14+, Edge 88+

## Contributing

Branchboard is designed to be extensible and customisable. Key areas for contribution include:

- **Scheduling Algorithms**: Development of more sophisticated optimisation methods
- **Signal Integrations**: Creation of connectors to external data sources
- **User Interface**: Enhanced visualisations and interaction patterns
- **Mobile Experience**: Touch-optimised interface implementations
